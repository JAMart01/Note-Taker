## What It Does

  When the user opens up the page they will be greeted by a homepage. This homepage has a buttons that links to the notes page. 
  When the user clicks on the button they are directed to the notes page. When they arrive on the notes page, if they have previous notes they will be there. 
  On the notes page the user can create and delete new note objects that are sent to the db.json file in the backend.
